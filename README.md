# CRUD-App

I have created a Node.js appliation that links with a SQLite DB to do the following tasks: 
 - The application must prompt the user for the creation of new data.
 - The application must read and display previously created data. 
 - The application must be able to update and delete existing data. 

Start the application from the GitBash command prompt using "node app.js".
Open the projet files and load the dog_breeds.html page in a web browser.
Next you can enter your favorite dog breed into the existing pool of entries(creation of new data).
When you submit your favorite dog breed the current top 5 favorite dog breeds will be displayed(read/display existing data).
Now you will be given the option to updte your current entry, or delete it. (update/delete existing data). 

You can check the DB project file in the "data" folder of my project to view the database.
